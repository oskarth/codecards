;; Why is this difficult Oskar?

;; Command to schedule a specific command can influence aggregate?
;; does that create event?

;; Commands can be rejected.
;; Events have happened.

;; Yes, I would say primarily in dispatching. Commands are dispatched to a single handler, but events are dispatched to multiple listeners. Granted, the implementation differences are in the buses, but I still use separate event and command interfaces, so that each bus only takes the messages it can. â€“ quentin-starin Feb 11 '11 at 16:39

;; Client issuing a command -> Command -> Command Handler -> Event -> Event Listeners/Projections

;; You should not raise event from event handler - just don't do it! You should use sagas instead.
;; Event listener that listens for reviewable cards and issues scheduling commands?
