When did I go live with payments? Jan 31 23:50, so really Feb 1 I guess

Simplest metric is just Home -> Checkout right? Then compare to number of actions.

Visited -> Used (actions) -> Paid


HOME -> GO LOGIN -> GO PAY -> CHECKOUT
1645

Funnel 1: Home -> Go login -> Go pay -> Checkout
Funnel 2: Home -> Signup banner -> Go pay -> Checkout
Funnel 3: Home -> Action -> Action -> Action

VISITS / PAY


Feb 1 - Feb 7:
Visits (2388)

I have 6 payments for $5. How many visits?

GA and Mixpanel ridiculously inaccurate. Why

Simplest possible metric. I know I charged 6 5, for how many sessions?

FEB 1 - FEB 7 2100 unique sessions, 6 payments = 0.3% conversion

cat server/events.log | grep -E "new-card|review-card" | grep -E "2017-02-01|2017-02-02|2017-02-03|2017-02-04|2017-02-05|2017-02-06|2017-02-06|2017-02-06" | wc -l
;; => 952 card actions (with unique tokens etc? here's where PSQL would be good)

I meant

This is GOOD ENOUGH THO. PAYMENT/SESSIONS or total revenue per session =

30/2100 = 0.014 (but doesn't count old active users, etc)

So how know if good? Well, if I for next 2000 unique sessions get less than 2 payments. Right?

Look into using https://piwik.org/ or analytics storing

also store commands

and events in pgdb


FEB 8 15:30 DOUBLE PRICES
